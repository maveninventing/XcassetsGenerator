XcassetsGenerator
=================

Java application to generate all xcassets images required by Xcode version 7+. You are supposed to provide three images of your app: icon.png, portrait.png and landscape.png and the program will create the entire xcassets. It creates the images to publish into appstore and googleplay too.

If you are an user, not a developer, just download the project and execute the "executa.bat" file to open the program.
